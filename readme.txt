Favorites for any post type. Easily add favoriting/liking, wishlists, or any other similar functionality using the developer-friendly API.

== Description ==

**Why Favorites?**

Favorites is designed for end users and theme developers. It provides an easy-to-use API for adding favorite button functionality to any post type.

The plugin can provide a way to save favorites, likes, bookmarks, or any other similar types of data with its customizable button text.

Visit [favoriteposts.com](http://favoriteposts.com) for a full list of available template functions and shortcodes.

**Features**

**Use with Any Post Type** - Enable or disable favorite functionality per post type while automatically adding a favorite button before and/or after the content. Or, use the included functions to display the button anywhere in your template.

**Available for All Users** – Don't want to hide functionality behind a login? Favorites includes an option to save anonymous users' favorites by either Session or Cookie. Logged-In users' favorites are also saved as user meta

**Designed for Developers** - Favorites works great out-of-the-box for beginners, but a full set of template functions unlocks just about any sort of custom functionality developers may need. Favorites outputs the minimum amount of markup needed, putting the style and control in your hands.

**GDPR**

As of version 2.2, a setting is provided to help comply with GDPR standards. To enable this setting, visit Settings > Favorites > Users, and check the field under "User Cookie Consent." When this setting is enabled, the content saved under the setting displays in a modal window, and the user must agree to the terms you provide before favorite cookies can be saved. Note: There is no language provided by default. This should be supplied by a qualified attorney or legal entity. Once the user has approved or denied cookies, that is saved in the "simplefavorites" cookie along with the timestamp of approval or denial. If the site is part of a multi-site installation, the setting will carry through to all sites.

If your site already has a cookie compliance solution in place, there are two document-level jQuery events that may be triggered in order to approve or deny cookies in the background.

To approve the use of cookies, trigger the event "favorites-user-consent-approved". To deny the use of cookies, trigger the event "favorites-user-consent-denied".

**Multisite Compatible** - As of version 1.1.0, Favorites is multisite compatible. User favorites are saved on a site/blog basis, and may be retrieved and displayed across sites.

For more information visit [favoriteposts.com](http://favoriteposts.com).

**Important: Favorites requires WordPress version 3.8 or higher, and PHP version 5.4 or higher.**


== Installation ==

1. Upload the favorites plugin directory to the wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Visit the plugin settings to configure display options
4. Use the template functions, display settings, or shortcodes to display the favorite button, favorite counts, and/or user favorites.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this worked on cached pages? =
Yes, although the buttons may display the incorrect state momentarily. Button states are updated via an AJAX call after page load in order to accommodate cached pages. This may be noticeable on slower servers.

= Is this plugin compatible with Multisite? =
As of version 1.1.0, Favorites is compatible with multisite installations. By default, all shortcodes and template functions will pull data from the site being viewed. Specific site IDs may be passed as parameters for more control. See the documentation for more information.
